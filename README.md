# GitTutorial

Material for learning how to use git and github with the research group.

Start of by reading through the [setup instructions](git_tutorial.md). 

Once you feel comfortable with the basics of git, move on to how to use github for collaboration by going through the exercise given in the [collaboration exercise.](colaboration_tutorial.md). For this you will need to download a simple python game as well found in [dice_game.py](dice_game.py)

For information about the workflow that we will use to organize our work have a look at the [feature branch workflow](feature_branch_workflow.md)

If you have any questions talk to Emil or Mike.
